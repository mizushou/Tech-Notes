### JavaFX Definition

P.1110 - 1111

- **1 stage > 1 scene(scene graph) > n nodes**
- The **stage** contains one active **scene** that defines GUI as a **scene graph**
- Each visual element in the scene graph is a **node**
- **root node** : the first node in the scene
graph
- Nodes can have children.
- type of nodes
  - **Layout containers**
    - VBox
    - GridPane
  - **Controls**
    - Labels
    - TextFields
    - Buttons
      - the control generates an
**event**
        - event handling
- An event handler is a **method** that responds to a user interaction.
  - **An FXML
GUI’s event handlers are defined in a so-called controller class**
- Class
  1. Stage (package javafx.stage )
  2. Scene (package javafx.scene )
  3. Node (package javafx.scene )

### How to make JavaFX Apps

P. 1119

1. Technologies Overview
 - Main.class
    - This is subclass of Application
    - methods
      1. *main*
        - calls class Application ’s static launch
  method to begin executing a JavaFX app
      1. *start*
        - call its start method, which creates
  the GUI, attaches it to a Scene and places it on the Stage that method start receives as
  an argument.
  - Event handling
    - **GUIs are event driven.**
When the user interacts with a GUI component, the interaction—known as an event—drives the program to perform a task.
    - **event handler** : The code that performs a task in response
to an event.
    - **event handling** : the process of responding to events
    - **How to make [Event handler]**
      1. Create a class that represents the event handler and implements an appropriate
interface—known as an **event-listener interface**.
        - ex) javafx.event.EventHandler
      2. Indicate that an object of that class should be notified when the event occurs—
known as **registering the event handler.**
  - controller class
    - The
controller class defines **instance variables** for interacting with controls programmatically,
as well as event-handling methods
      - view <-- instance valiable --> controller class
    - The controller class may also declare additional
instance variables, static variables and methods that support the app’s operation.
    - @FXML : This is annotation. This is used in a **JavaFX controller
class**’s code to mark **instance variables that should refer to JavaFX components in
the GUI’s FXML file and methods that can respond to the events of JavaFX com-
ponents in the GUI’s FXML file**.
  - FXMLLoader class
    - When a JavaFX FXML app begins executing, class FXMLLoader ’s static method load is
used to load the FXML file that represents the app’s GUI. This method:
      1. Creates the GUI’s scene graph and returns a Parent (package javafx.scene ) ref-
erence to the scene graph’s root node.
      2. Initializes the controller’s instance variables for the components that are manip-
ulated programmatically
      3. Creates and registers the event handlers for any events specified in the FXML.
  - When the to initialize the controller.
FXMLLoader creates an object of class TipCalculatorController , **it determines whether
the class contains an initialize method with no parameters and, if so, calls that method** -> initialize()@controller class
  - fx:id
    - The variable names that you specify in the controller class must precisely
match the fx:id values you specified when building the GUI.
  - start method
    - override start metod@Application
      - Returns a **Parent** (package javafx.scene ) reference to the scene graph’s **root
node** (the GridPane in this example)
      - **Creates an object of the controller class.**
      - **Initializes the controller’s instance variables** for the components that are manip-
ulated programmatically -> initialize()@controller class?
      - Registers the event handlers for any events specified in the FXML -> initialize()@controller class?

### Event Handler

---
- Example) Button-onAcion
  - How to implemente
      - no ues Controller class (you need implement event-listener interface)
        1. Make target (A target can be a window, scene, and a node.)
        1. Make EventHandler and Register the EventHandler.
```
Button btn = new Button();
btn.setText("Say 'Hello World'");
// onAction-EventHandler
btn.setOnAction(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() {
    @Override
    public void handle(ActionEvent event) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
});
```

    - use Controller class (you don't need implement event-listener interface)
      1. Make method as EventHandler with @FXML annotation
      1. Register the EventHandler by SceneBuilder

### FXML

- root node must have 2 element.
  1. fx:controller
    - It needs to specify EventHandler based on Controller
  1. xmlns:fx


### Be careful

----

1. id'name is same to instance valiable name.
1. import package
1. After changing to lamda, you don't need to override ChangeListener or ObservableValue.
